# Machine Learning--Breast Cancer Diagnosis via Different Machine Learning Technique(PCA, Linear Regression and Logistics Regression)

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different Machine Learning models for automatic diagnosis of breast cancer.

In this project, the dataset contains 30 carefully selected features from each of ​569 patients. The same dataset has also been made available from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29).
